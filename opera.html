    <h3>HMS Pinnafore </h3>
    <h4>Act - 2<br>
        Same Scene. Night. Awning removed. Moonlight. CAPTAIN
        discovered
             singing on poop deck, and accompanying himself on a
        mandolin. LITTLE
             BUTTERCUP seated on quarterdeck, gazing sentimentally at
        him.</h4>

        <h5 class="CHORUS"> CHORUS </h5>
        <h6 class="BUT"> BUT. </h6> 
        <p class="d"> How sweetly he carols forth his melody to the 
    unconscious
    moon! Of whom is he thinking? Of some high-born beauty? It may
    be! Who is
    poor Little Buttercup that she should expect his glance to fall
    on one so
    lowly! And yet if he knew—if he only knew!

                DUET—LITTLE BUTTERCUP and CAPTAIN </p>

         <h6 class="BUT">BUT.</h6>     
     <p>Black sheep dwell in every fold;
                 All that glitters is not gold;
                 Storks turn out to be but logs;
                   Bulls are but inflated frogs.</p>
    
        <h6 class="CAPT"> CAPT.</h6>   
    <p> Wink is often good as nod;
                poils the child who spares the rod;
                Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers;
                Dogs are found in many mangers. </p>              
    
         <h6 class="SIRJOSEPH">SIR JOSEPH.</h6> 
        <p>She naturally would be.</p> 

   <h6 class="JOS">JOS.</h6>  
   <p>That the high and the lowly may be truly happy together,
    provided that they truly love one another?</p>

   <h6 class="DICK"> DICK (mysteriously).</h6><p> I'm come to give you warning.</p>

   <h6 class=""ALL/>ALL.</h6>        <p> That he is an Englishman!</p> 
   <h6 class="BOAT"> BOAT.</h6>       <p> For he might have been a Roosian,
                 A French, or Turk, or Proosian,
                 Or perhaps Itali-an!</p>
