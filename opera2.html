    <p> Wink is often good as nod;
                poils the child who spares the rod;
                Thirsty lambs run foxy dangers;
                Dogs are found in many mangers. </p>

    <p>Good fellow, in conundrums you are speaking,
        Sing hey, the mystic sailor that you are;
     The answer to them vainly I am seeking;
        Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.</p>

    <p>  The merry maiden and the tar.</p>
        <h6 class="DICK">DICK.</h6>
    <p> Kind Captain, your young lady is a-sighing,
        Sing hey, the simple captain that you are,
     This very might with Rackstraw to be flying;
        Sing hey, the merry maiden and the tar.</p>
